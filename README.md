Compiled_Android_Launcher4.2.2
==============================

As the day before ,I want to find some Compiled launcer code sample . 

I find only CompilingLauncher2 and the adwlauncher.

I hope this can help someone .

the code is from the android source code .

the depend library is from the libs that I compiled the android source code 4.2.2.

three depend libs.

- android_common_intermediates
- core_intermediates
- framework_intermediates 

the added depend libs is on this rule.

*android_common_intermediates* is the build lib from 

${Build.Path}/out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/android-common_intermediates.
